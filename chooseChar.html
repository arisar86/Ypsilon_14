        You are 32 years old, a never do well with a talent of getting into
        trouble. You are trained as a mechanic and worked before with heavy
        machinery and in zero-g. You are not the smartest but your agility,
        strength and witts seem to always make you slip out in the right
        moments. You took the job as a miner on Ypsilon-14 to escape an
        interstellar judical conviction. Your collegues don't know about that
        and it is up to you as a player to make up what crime you commited.

        You have just completed your studies and applied for this unusual job on
        Ypsilon-14 because you heard that your great idol Dr. Giovanni is
        conducting secret research on this colony. You hope to get closer to
        him, in the best case, to complete your doctorate under his guidance.
        You are an expert in botany and trained in geology. You have a quirky
        personality and people often think you are immature or naive, but you
        know exactly what you want and, thanks to your high intellect, know how
        to get it.

        You are an android of the B-Series that might be seen as outtaded but is
        still put to use on many colonies and mining stations. You are hired by
        Lyonell Corp. as an engineer to assist the miners and scientists on
        Ypsilon-14 but your protocol also says to ensure that all “test
        subjects“ (whatever that means) perform their tasks and under no
        circumstance must interfer with Dr.Giovannis research, although you
        don't know what the research really entails.
