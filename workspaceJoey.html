    <h1 class="text">
      Work boots clang and echo through the workspace of the mining station. The
      air is damp and heavy, a mix of sweat and oily machinery. You take a deep
      breath and look around. On the left wall cubies are lining up, probably
      stowing the gear of the workers. Just next to the cubies a cramped
      corridor leads to the crews quarters. To your right a massive generator
      sits in one corner by an industrial vent alongside a computer terminal
      slowly bleeping out lines of data. In the opposite corner, white sheet
      plastic and sterile lightning marks a semi-permanent Medbay. The floor in
      the middle of the room opens up into a yawning pit, with a mechanised
      drill and pump system penetrating down into the dark mine shaft. A rather
      spartan freight elevator carries miners to and from the mine entrance.
